# KNWLDGBox - OSINT & Tools Platform

KNWLDGBox is a platform for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Media Tools. It provides a modular web interface to manage data leaks, social forensics, network graphs, media downloading, image forensics, and more.

The project is split into two parts:
- **Backend**: A FastAPI Python server handling background tasks, WebSockets, APIs, and external tool integrations (like `yt-dlp`, `holehe`, `sherlock`, etc.).
- **Frontend**: A Vue.js application using Vite for a fast and reactive user experience.

---

## Prerequisites

Depending on how you plan to run KNWLDGBox, you will need different prerequisites.

### 🐳 For Docker Users (Recommended)
You only need to install Docker:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose.

*(Note: The Docker container automatically includes Node.js, Python, Git, and Chromium, so you do **not** need to install them on your host machine!)*

### 💻 For Local Development
If you prefer to run the app manually without Docker, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10+** (with `venv` support) for the backend.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended) and `npm` for the frontend.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Chromium Browser** (Required for the Local Archives module to generate screenshots and PDFs). On Ubuntu/Debian, install it via: `sudo apt install chromium`

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### 1. Backend Setup (Python)

We highly recommend using a virtual environment to keep your Python dependencies isolated.

1. **Create and activate a new virtual environment (`venv`)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv knwldg
   source knwldg/bin/activate  # On Windows use: knwldg\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Copy the example environment file and fill in your API keys (Shodan, VirusTotal, Telegram API, etc.).
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```
   
   *(Note: You can configure API keys directly through the "Settings" tab in the web interface later. See the Tutorials section below for guides on getting specific API keys.). And use example.env or .env.example in copy.*

### 2. Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

1. **Open a new terminal window** (or keep the same if you prefer to run things sequentially) and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🚀 How to Launch the Application

We have provided two convenient scripts depending on how you want to run the application.

<details>
<summary><b>💻 Local Development Mode</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

Use this method if you are running the app on your local computer for development or personal use.

Simply run this command from the root of the project:
```bash
./start.sh
```

- The script automatically activates the `knwldg` virtual environment and executes the backend.
- The frontend will start in development mode (`npm run dev`).
- To stop both servers, simply press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

*(Alternatively, you can manually start the backend in one terminal with `uvicorn main:app --reload` and the frontend in another terminal with `npm run dev`).*
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌍 Home Server / Production Mode (Docker)</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

Use this method if you are hosting the app on a home server (e.g., accessed via Tailscale or LAN).

This approach uses Docker and Docker Compose to containerize the entire application into a single production-ready image. Persistent data (API keys, media, and investigation graphs) is securely saved on your host machine so it survives restarts.

Simply run this command from the root of the project:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

- The application will be automatically built and started in the background on **port 8000** (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
- All your configurations, OSINT reports, and data will be safely saved in `data/app/` in your project folder.
- Downloaded media will be directly available in your host machine at `~/Downloads/KNWLDGBox/`.
- You can check the logs anytime with `docker compose logs -f`.
- To stop the application, run `docker compose down`.

## 📚 Tutorials & Setup Guides

Here are quick guides for setting up external APIs used by KNWLDGBox.

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 How to Setup OpenRouter AI Summaries</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

KNWLDGBox allows you to summarize all your active RSS feeds and Telegram channels at once using LLMs via OpenRouter.

1. **Get an API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) and create a free account.
   - Generate a new API Key in your account settings.

2. **Configure KNWLDGBox**:
   - Open your KNWLDGBox web interface.
   - Navigate to the **Settings** tab (the gear icon).
   - Under the **OSINT APIs** section, paste your API key into the `OpenRouter API Key` field.
   - Select your preferred AI model from the dropdown (e.g., *Gemini 2.0 Flash*, *Mistral 7B*, *Nvidia Nemotron*, etc.).
   - Click the **Save Configurations** button at the top right.

3. **Generate Summaries**:
   - Go to the **Monitoring** tab.
   - Add your RSS feeds or Telegram channels and make sure they are active.
   - Click the **✨ AI Daily Summary** button located at the top right of the Monitoring view.
   - A global summary card will appear above your feeds, synthesizing the most important events across all your active sources!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📱 How to Get Telegram API Credentials</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

To use the Telegram OSINT features, you need a Telegram API ID and Hash. 

1. Go to [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and log in with your phone number.
2. Click on "API development tools".
3. Create a new application (the name doesn't matter).
4. Copy the **App api_id** and **App api_hash** into your `.env` file (or directly in the application's **Settings** tab).

## 📦 Building for Production

If you want to build the frontend for production (e.g., to serve static files from a production web server):
```bash
cd app
npm run build
```
The compiled assets will be placed in the `app/dist` directory.
